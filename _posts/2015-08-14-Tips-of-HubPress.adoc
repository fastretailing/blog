= Tips of HubPress

:published_at: 2015-08-14


Hi, I'm Hiroaki Miura. I'm working as a developer at Fast Retailing.

My hobbies, aside from programming, are collecting funny pictures of cats and making a study about how to properly approach a cat without making it run away. I am confident that when my study achieves a good outcome, I will win a Nobel Prize.

Anyway, I'm in charge of mobile application development, but now I'd like to write about HubPress.

HubPress is a web application to build a blog on GitHub. This blog is built taking advantage of it.

I think HubPress is the best practice as a developer blog platform. Because it's simple, free, open-source, easy to setup, and hosted on Github where most of the developers are familiar with.

For setup, to use hubpress.io words, only these stuffs.

_Fork the hubpress.io repository, +
update the config file and it's done, +
your Blog is ready._

At first I was using Wordpress.com. But once I tried installing HubPress, I finished installation, some configuration, and design for a day. I actually find it easy to use.

After installation, you may see the page like this.

But there are a few things might be confusing when writing a blog. So let me share you some of the information needed.

=== Blog Title is required

Saving and publishing blog will end in failure if it doesn't have a blog title. Though an error dialog only shows a common message. It may take a bit time to get the cause.

=== How to embed a image 

There's not any image managing function. So you need to upload an image from anywhere to embed an image to a blog. If you do so, you can embed it with asciidoc syntax, just like below.

`image::http://<full path to image>[]`

Or you can push an image to `<repository root>/images`  directory. Then you can use a relative path.

`image::<filename>[]`

Also you can add some attributes to the image, such as a size, position, caption etc.

=== Authorization

All users are authorized by Github account. All GitHub Pages are public and any Github users can login to your HubPress Administration console via internet. But updating operations are restricted based on its repository's access control just as a normal GitHub repository.

HubPress may be accepting developers contribution, as of now it is also preparing for this. I'd like to contribute to it as a developer!
