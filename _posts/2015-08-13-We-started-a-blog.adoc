Hello. Weâ€™ve just launched the Developers blog!

Fast Retailing is a leading global Japanese apparel group, and we're in the Digital, E-Commerce, and Infra team.

It's a little known fact that we have dozens of distinguished engineers from different countries!

We're continually striving to be the best, and also consequently upgrading and developing new web applications using the latest technology.

With this blog, we'll be able to share knowledge with our fellow engineersðŸ˜‰
